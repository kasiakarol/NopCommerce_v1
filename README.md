Selenium with Python E-commerce automation project
---------------------------------------------------

The purpose of the project is to automate one test case from each of the 30 test scenarios for the E-Commerce demo application: "https://demo.nopcommerce.com/". 
A list of test scenarios with the corresponding test cases can be found in "NopCommerce-TestCases" sheet.

The framework of the project was part of the "Learn Selenium with Python, PyTest + Live Project" course I completed.  
My contribution to the project is the creation of Page Objects, Test Cases, and Random String function, which is a part of utilities package. 

The test cases presented cover only below categories of the products available in the e-shop:
1) Computers > Notebooks
2) Electronics > Cell phones
3) Electronics > Others
4) Digital downloads 
5) Books
